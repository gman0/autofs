LDAP Schema
===========

LDAP Schema definitions may be found in the samples sub-directory.

The ldap schema rfc2307.schema and rfc2307bis.schema may be used by
autofs for Sun format automount maps, the choice of which is used is
dependent on user needs. They are included for reference only as at
least one of these should be included in LDAP server distributions.

The ldap schema am-utils-ldap.schema and am-utils-ldap-id.txt describe
the schema used by autofs for amd format maps.
